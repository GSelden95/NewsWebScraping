# NewsWebScraping
I web scraped The New York Times and Fox News using Python to assess journalist sentiment regarding major political candidates. 

Shout out to Peter Kritikos for helping me write this code. He brilliantly constructed the function all_nyt(candidate) and then I was able to use his knowledge on my own time, to construct the all_fox(candidate) function. 

Peter has been a Senior Software Developer at a multitude of companies for many years and has worked professionally in the field for 10 years. For a portion of his career he worked at Meta. 

I also created a WordCloud of the data using my own coding knowledge from the Word Cloud library, although the word cloud isn't representative of which words are used the most (this may be a first draft, I may post more code later.) 

READ THIS: I removed my API keys. You can sign up for one on the New York Times Web API, the liberal source I used (https://developer.nytimes.com/apis) and the News API (https://newsapi.org/), the conservative source I used.
